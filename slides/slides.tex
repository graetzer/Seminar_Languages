\NewPage\headline{Introduction}

\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item Word embeddings are real valued vector representations for words.
\item This talk is about generating word embeddings and their applications.
\item Specifically:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Generating word embeddings by composing their individual character representations
  \item Using Long short-term memory to capture complex relationships between words.
\end{itemize}
\item The resulting model can be used for many tasks, such as language modeling or part-of-speech tagging
\item Reduces the need for manual feature engineering
\item Can improve performance for many tasks
\end{itemize}

\end{center}
\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item Natural language processing systems can treat words as atomic symbols, encoded as indexes.
\item E.g.\ 'apple' might become index \textit{Id123} and 'orange' becomes index \textit{Id124}
\item This way of encoding is very sparse, and arbitrary.
\item No representation of the relationship between these word types (such as both are fruit, \dots).
\end{itemize}

\begin{minipage}[b]{.6\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item A statistical model should be able to learn relationships between word types.
\item Transform a word type $w$ and turn it into an embedding $e_w = v(w) \in \mathbb{R}^d$
\item Words with a similar meaning should be mapped to (geometrically) nearby points in the vector space.
\item The dimension $d$ should be low compared to the vocabulary size.
\item Capture the intuition that words may be similar along different dimensions.
\end{itemize}
\end{minipage}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\NewPage\headline{Word Embeddings} 
\hypertarget{sli:goals}{}

\vfill
 To this end there are some assumptions we make:
\begin{itemize}
\item Words which share semantic meaning tend to occur in the same contexts (Distributional Hypothesis)
\item The composition of words themselves can sometimes hint at similarities (e.g.\ 'apple' \textit{vs} 'apples')
\end{itemize}
\vfill



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\NewPage\headline{General Approach for Word Embeddings} 

\vfill
Generating word embeddings within a NNLM to better estimate $p(w_i | w_1,\dots,w_{i-1})$
\begin{enumerate}
\item Associate each word $w$ in the vocabulary $V$ with a word embedding $e_w$
\item Express the joint probability function for the word sequence $w_1,\dots,w_{i-1}$ in terms of these embeddings.
\item Simultaniously learn the word embeddings and the parameters of the probability function.
\end{enumerate}

\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[c]{.5\linewidth}
\begin{itemize}
\item The context for $w_i$ is approximated with n-grams.
\item Input word types are encoded as one-hot vectors.
\item First Hidden Layer: Lookup table $P \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times |V|}$, projects the input into a continouus vector space.
\item The word embedding $e_w$ is the output of layer $P$.
\item Second Hidden Layer: Estimates the joint probability of the word sequence
\item The Softmax-Layer projects this up to vocabulary size $|V|$
    %, calculating $p(w_i = k | w_1,\dots,w_{i-1})$ for every word-type $k \in V$.

\end{center}

\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item This setup can be used to generate a large table of word embeddings.
\item Lookup table can be reused for other tasks (if there is not enough training data).
\item E.g.\ [Mikolov et al 2013] have created a model which can encode complex patterns:
\item ${\displaystyle v(\mathrm {king} )-v(\mathrm {male} )+v(\mathrm {female} )\approx v(\mathrm {queen} )}$.

%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item The input vector $z$ is computed over the vocabulary: $z_k \forall k \in V$.

%  \item Probability given the context: $p_k = p(w_i = k | w_{i-n+1}^{i-1})$

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\NewPage\headline{Shortcomings}

\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item A model with a lookup table treats each word embedding as independent from each other. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item The model captures smililar linear correspondences between words embeddings.
  \item E.g.\ \textit{cat} and \textit{apple} compared to \textit{cats} and \textit{apples}.
  \item It doesn't capture that the added \textit{s} is responsible for this transformation.
  \item The model doesn't examine lexical similarities between words.
  \item It doesn't capture morphological word transformations: e.g.\ \textit{test} vs.\ \textit{testing}
\end{itemize}
\item A word lookup table cannot easily deal with unknown words.
\item The lookup table contains at least $|V| \times d$ parameters. This can require large amount of memory for tasks with large vocabularies.
\end{itemize}
\vfill

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\NewPage\headline{Possible Solutions}

\vfill
Some requirements should be satisfied by a better model:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The model should capture\textsuperscript{*} orthographic similarities between words
        e.g.\ \textit{test} vs.\ \textit{testing} (Compositional effects).
  \item The model must still capture functionally similar words, with no orthographic
        similarities e.g.\ \textit{rich} vs.\ \textit{affluent}.
  \item However not all similary spelled words have similar meanings e.g.\ \textit{butter} vs.\ \textit{batter}.
  \item The resulting model should be able to replace the previous projection layer.
  \item Idea: Break down words into smaller atomic units and try to \textit{compose} them into word embeddings.
\end{itemize}
\vfill
{\footnotesize *) In terms of geometric locality}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\NewPage\headline{Possible Solution 1: Morpheme-based Embeddings}

\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item Morphemes are the smallest defined grammatical unit of a language.
\item E.g.\ "Unbreakable" comprises three morphemes: 
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item un-
    \item -break-
    \item -able
  \end{enumerate}
\item Use morphemes as input and compose them into the word embeddings.
\item Requires a morphological analyser: Extra processing step.
\item Each target language requires an extra morpological analyser.
\item The quality of the model depends on the analyser.
\end{itemize}
\vfill

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\NewPage\headline{Possible Solution 2: Character-based Embeddings}

\vfill
\begin{itemize}
  \item Break down words into characters
  \item Represent characters as real valued feature vectors (character embeddings).
  \item Feed them to an recurrent neural net, which "remembers" each character.
  \item Learn character embeddings simultaniously with other model parameters.
\end{itemize}

The "Compositional Character to Word" (C2W) model:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A word $w$ with length $m$ is decomposed into characters $c_1, \dots, c_m$ from the alphabet $C$.
\item Transform characters into a sequence of character embeddings $e_{c_1}, \dots, e_{c_m}$.
\item The sequence is "read" one-by-one \textbf{forwards} as well as \textbf{backwards} by two LSTMs.
\item During "reading" the sequence is composed into the forward state $s_m^f$ and backward state $s_1^b$.
\item The two states are recomposed to form the word-embedding $e_w$.

\NewPage\headline{C2W-Model vs Word Lookup Tables}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lookup Tables are conceptually much simpler, but requires a lot of parameters ($|V| \times d$).
\item The C2W model uses less parameters (more in the evaluation section).
\item The C2W model can easily be used for open vocabulary tasks.
\item Looking up a word embedding is in $O(1)$, whereas the C2W model has to compute the embedding
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Can be aliviated by caching $e_w$ for frequently occuring words.
  \item However cached values still need to be recomputed when parameters change during training time.
  \end{itemize}

We are going to introduce three use cases, where a C2W based model either:
\begin{itemize}
\item Outperforms a model which uses much more parameters.
\item Yields comparable results without relying on manually engineered features.

\item Process of labeling words as corresponding to a particular part of speech
\item For example a simple tagging would be to identify words as nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, etc.
\item One use of this is to disambiguate homonyms:\\ For Example "I fish a fish" should become "Je pÃªche un poisson" in french.
\item By tagging the first occurance of "fish" as verb and the second as noun, they are now distinct.

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The word embedding $e$ from the encoder.
    \item Current character of the original word $c_j$
    \item Previous output of the model

\NewPage\headline{Summary}

\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item Generating word embeddings by composing character representations, works usually just as well
      as approaches using word lookup tables.
\item Lexical features can be learned automatically, manual feature engineering can be avoided
\item In combination with caching of frequently used words, the performance is comparable to models based on word lookup tables.
\item Models scale better with larger vocabularies and are able to deal with open vocabularies.
